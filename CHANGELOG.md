0.1.1 - 22 June 2012
--------------------

[See all commits](https://github.com/kjbekkelund/simple/compare/v0.1.0...v0.1.1)

* Get rid of `Object.create` dependency.
* Removed dependency to [EventEmitter](https://github.com/Wolfy87/EventEmitter).
  There are no breaking changes to the event API.
* Expose `Simple.Events` to make it easier to use the event library
  outside of Simple.js itself, e.g. for global event handling. Now
  events can be added to any object:

  ```javascript
  var obj = {};
  $.extend(obj, Simple.Events)
  ```
* URLs can now be defined using a function, not only as a variable, e.g.

  ```javascript
  var MyModel = Simple.Model.extend({
    url: function() {
      return "/url";
    }
  });
  ```
* Add local events to `Simple.View`, which means that you can now bind,
  unbind and trigger events on a view instance:

  ```javascript
  var view = new Simple.View();
  view.on("test", function() { console.log("triggered!") });
  view.trigger("test"); // triggered!
  view.off("test");
  ```
